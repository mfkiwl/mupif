        Represents a function.

        Usage of class Function for data transfers between codes as with Field or Property is deprecated.
        It is not supposed for data transfers any more, thus becomes an auxiliary class.

        Function is an object defined by mathematical expression. Function can depend on spatial position and time.
        Derived classes should implement evaluate service by providing a corresponding expression.
        
        Example: f(x,t)=sin(2*3.14159265*x(1)/10.)

            A dictionary is container type that can store any number of Python objects, 
            including other container types. Dictionaries consist of pairs (called items) 
            of keys and their corresponding values.
            
            Example: d={'x':(1,2,3), 't':0.005} initializes dictionary contaning tuple (vector) under 'x' key, double value 0.005 under 't' key. Some common keys: 'x': position vector 't': time
