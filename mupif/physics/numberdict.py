# Dictionary containing numbers
#
# These objects are meant to be used like arrays with generalized
# indices. Non-existent elements default to zero. Global operations
# are addition, subtraction, and multiplication/division by a scalar.

    Dictionary storing numerical values

    Constructor: NumberDict()

    An instance of this class acts like an array of number with
    generalized (non-integer) indices. A value of zero is assumed
    for undefined entries. NumberDict instances support addition,
    and subtraction with other NumberDict instances, and multiplication
    and division by scalars.
