What is there
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains MuPIF API implementation for OOFEM.org solver.

Prerequsities:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The oofem solver has to be build with USE_PYTHON_BINDINGS ON


To test the API, the liboofem.so (created when building oofem target) must be
discoverable by python, i.e., located where python looks for modules.
This can be done e.g. by symlinking to the .so in the build directory
by running something like

ln -s /oofem-build-dir/liboofem.so /home/user/oofem-build/liboofem.so

or by setting PYTHONPATH environment variable accordingly.

Testing:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The oofem API can be tested by running python on module itself:

python oofem.py
