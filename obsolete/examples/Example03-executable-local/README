This example illustrates the top level control script representing
simulation pipeline made of two simple applications. 
The overall simulation is performed in a time loop, 
where one application provides data for the second application, 
which computes the arithmetical average value of given data.

The main difference to Example01 is that the second application, 
computing the avarage is considered as external executable. The Python wrapper
implementing Application interface around this application is created. 
Its role is to cache the mapped properties, execute the external
application and parse its output, when data are requested. 

To run the example, the application3 should be compiled on your system
using any c compiler. For example, on unix/linux use following command
to create an executable:

$ gcc -o application3 application3.c

To run this example, invoke python interpreter on Example03.py:
$ python Example03.py
