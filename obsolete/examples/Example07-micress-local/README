This example illustrates a skeleton for Micress API (defined in Micress.py). 
It shows how to import vtk data files into internal framework
representation using fields defined on general structured grid.
It evaluates field position at specific point from micress/sim.vtk file.


To run the example:
-------------------
> python Example06.py


If you have this error when you run the example:
> SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

it comes from pyvtk package. You have to open the PolyData.py and Scalars.py source code files, and replace all split(' ') by split().

This error is explained in details here:
