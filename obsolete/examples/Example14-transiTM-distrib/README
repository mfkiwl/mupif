This example illustrates two applications running through a VPN connection. No need to create ssh tunnels. Both applications run on a server (mech.fsv.cvut.cz) while the scenario script runs on a local machine. This example is based on Example13.py.

Prerequisites:
You need to set up a VPN connection. There are several ways, our approach uses openvpn client. In such particular case, locate mupif1.ovpn file and run as a root
$ openvpn mupif1.ovpn
which will create VPN connection to mech.fsv.cvut.cz server. Then, all communication runs on a network 172.30.0.6 (client) with 172.30.0.1 (server, mech.fsv.cvut.cz)

Running:
On a server side (mech.fsv.cvut.cz) run a nameserver $python3 tools/nameserver.py -m2. Run $python3 thermalServer.py -m2. Run $python3 mechanicalServer.py -m2
On a client side run $python3 Example14.py -m2

Local version:
All servers and clients can run with the argument -m0, i.e. local mode.
