This example illustrates the top level control script representing 
simulation pipeline made of two simle applications. The overall
simulation is performed in a time loop, where one application 
provides data for the second application, which computes the 
arithmetical average value of given data. The data exchange is
here illustrated using property exchange for simplicity. 

Even though its simplicity, it illustrates the basic concept of
steering, mutual data exchange, and error handling using the
proposed API. Everything runs on a local computer. 

To run this example, invoke python interpreter on Example01.py:
$ python Example01.py
