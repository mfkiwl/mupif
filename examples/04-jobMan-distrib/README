This Example04 is derived from Example02 and uses JobManager on a server to allocate one remote application.

The standard mode -m0 uses the following configuration:
JobManager on port 44382
Allocated application on port 9095 (server) with NAT 6000 (local). This needs one ssh tunnel.

The mode -m2 or -m3 uses the same configuration as -m0, except that allocated application uses only port 9095 with no NAT and no ssh tunnel. 

Run nameserver.py, server.py and Example04.py in three terminals.
