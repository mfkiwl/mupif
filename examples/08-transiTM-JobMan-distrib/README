This example illustrates two applications running on a network over VPN and this example is based on Example06.py. NameServer runs on mech.fsv.cvut.cz. JobManager for thermalServer runs on mech.fsv.cvut.cz. MechanicalServer and scenario script runs on a local computer. No ssh tunnels are created for JobManager and for a thermalServer, communication runs on a VPN network. In such particular case, serverNathost=server, serverNatport=serverPort. VPN can access ports on remote server directly.

Prerequisites:
Correct configuration in Config.py.

Running in distributed mode (e.g. VPN):
On a server side (mech.fsv.cvut.cz) run nameserver $python3 tools/nameserver.py -m2 and $python3 thermalServer.py -m2.
On a client side run $python3 mechanicalServer.py -m2 and $python3 Example16.py -m2

Running in local mode: omit -m2 so the default value is used (-m0).
